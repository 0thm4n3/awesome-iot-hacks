# Awesome IoT Hacks
A Collection of Hacks in IoT Space so that we can address them (hopefully).

## Analysis and Reports

- [HP 2014 Report](http://www8.hp.com/h20195/V2/GetPDF.aspx/4AA5-4759ENW.pdf)  
> 90% of devices collected at least one piece of personal information via the
> device, the cloud, or its mobile application. 70% of devices used unencrypted
> netwrok service. Six out of 10 devices that provide user interfaces were
> vulnerabele to a range of issues such as persistent XSS and weak
> credentials...

- [The Internet of Fails](http://www.slideshare.net/markstanislav/the-internet-of-fails-where-iot-has-gone-wrong-and-how-were-making-it-right)  
> This presentation will dive into research, outcomes, and recommendations
> regarding information security for the "Internet of Things". Mark and Zach
> will discuss IoT security failures both from their own research as well as the
> work of people they admire. Attendees are invited to laugh/cringe at
> concerning examples of improper access control, a complete lack of transport
> security, hardcoded-everything, and ways to bypass paying for stuff.

## Community

- [IoT Village<sup>TM</sup>](https://www.iotvillage.org/)  
> The village consists of workshops on hacking numerous off-the-shelf devices
> (e.g. medical devices, home appliances, routers, and storage devices), live
> educational talks and a variety of contests.

## IoT Hacks

### IP Cameras

> Because the web server requires authentication to access it (normally) we can
> use this information to fingerprint the camera easily. We can use the realm of
> 'netcam' to conduct our searches
